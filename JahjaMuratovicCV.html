                    IUS student application <br>
                    <i>Project Description: </i> Firstly, I was very unsatisfied with the current IUS student 
                    system in the terms of UI and UX so I figured out that I could make a Kotlin script that
                    uses JSoup to log in and scrape the grades and University course schedules for me, and after
                    that my goal was to present the student info in a most user friendly way. I started 
                    developing it in Kotlin and Android Studio for retrieving student data from the main IUS
                    student system site. It has some simple UI for now, it is in ver. 0.1 and available for 
                    download from my GitHub profile.

                    the data from mobile.de and Olx.ba after that I cleaned the data as much as I could, then I 
                    started drawing graphs and maps based on the postal codes of cars, after that I started writing
                    conclusions based on the available data. The subject of Analysis were comparison of Bosnian and
                    German markets by analysing price, mileage and car feature differences of Mercedes E-Classes
                    Available on Mobile.de and on Olx.ba. The scripts, the work, and the maps are available on
